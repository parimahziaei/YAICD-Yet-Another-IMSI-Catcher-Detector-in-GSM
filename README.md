# YAICD-Yet-Another-IMSI-Catcher-Detector-in-GSM
YAICD consists of a sensor that can be installed on Android mobile devices. It detects ICs by extracting 15 parameters from signals received from BTSs. We also established a lab-scale testbed to evaluate YAICD for various detection parameters and comparing it against existing solutions in the literature. The experimental results show that not only YAICD successfully detects ICs using the parameters but also it identifies ICs to which users are not yet connected to the network
